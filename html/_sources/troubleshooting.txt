Troubleshooting
===============

If you have trouble using the Gini API and you need to contact the support, there are some information
you should always provide in order to help you quickly and efficiently.

X-Request-Id
------------

The request id is generated for every request against the Gini API and tracked through the whole system. It is
included in every response you receive from the Gini API as the HTTP header ``X-Request-Id``. Please refer to it when you
contact our support.

Document Id
-----------

The document id is generated for every  accepted upload. It is included in the ``Location`` HTTP header
which is part of the response for a successful upload. Please refer to the document id if you have questions
related to a specific document upload.
