Overview
========

Media Types
-----------

Custom media types are used in the API to let consumers choose the
version of the data format they wish to receive. This is done by adding one or
more of the following media types to the ``Accept`` header when a request is made.
Media types are specific to resources, allowing them to change independently
and supporting formats that other resources don't.

The media types consumed and produced by the Gini API look like this::

    application/vnd.gini[.version][+json]

.. warning::

   If you don't specify a version in your requests, the API's
   responses might change without further notice. It is strongly
   recommended to always specify a specific API version.

.. todo:: This section sounds an awful lot like http://developer.github.com/v3/media/

.. _overview-versions:


Versions
--------

Currently there is one stable version of the Gini API. Future versions can be
requested using a specific ``Accept`` header. Additionally, we provide a unstable
incubator version of the Gini API. This is primarily for testing new extractions but
may affect other parts of the Gini API as well.

v1
~~

Gini API v1 is stable and will not be changed in an incompatible way. Please
contact us via api@gini.net if you have any problems.

By default all requests receive data in version 1 of the API. Developers are
strongly encouraged to explicitly specify the required version of the Gini API
using the HTTP/1.1 ``Accept`` header:

::

    Accept: application/vnd.gini.v1+json


incubator
~~~~~~~~~

Gini API incubator is unstable and can change at any time. We will provide new and immature 
features (e.g. extractions) exclusively under this Gini API version. We encourage developers to test these
features and to give us feedback under api@gini.net. The incubating features are accessible by
using the HTTP/1.1 ``Accept`` header:

::

    Accept: application/vnd.gini.incubator+json

See :ref:`incubator` for further informations.

Authentication
--------------

Only authenticated users are allowed to make API requests. The Gini
API uses the `OAuth 2.0 protocol
<http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749.html>`_ with `bearer tokens
<http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6750.html>`_ for authentication. To use
the Gini API within your application, you first have to register your
application with Gini. Then your application requests an access token
from the Gini Authorization Server and uses that token to access the
Gini API.

See :ref:`guide-oauth2` for a detailed overview about the
authorization process and how to implement it in your application.


Security
--------

The Gini API is only accessible over HTTPS. Please make sure that your
application validates the relevant X.509 certificates (e.g. common
name matches hostname, issuing CA is trusted, etc.).

.. todo:: Maybe add the current fingerprint of our X.509 certificate(s)?


Client Errors
-------------

HTTP response codes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The API uses idiomatic HTTP status codes to indicate if a request was
successful, and if not, whether it should be retried.

+--------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Code   | Description                                                           |
+========+=======================================================================+
| 2xx    | The request was successful.                                           |
+--------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 4xx    | The request was not successful. See the response body for details.    |
|        | Retrying with the same arguments will not work.                       |
+--------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 5xx    | Some error occurred while processing the request. Please try again.   |
+--------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

Error entity
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Gini API always returns a JSON object further describing the error which 
occurred. The JSON object consists of the following properties:

+-----------+---------+--------------------------------------------------+
| Name      | Type    | Description                                      |
+===========+=========+==================================================+
| message   | string  | Human consumable error description (**not**      |
|           |         | intended for application end-users)              |
+-----------+---------+--------------------------------------------------+
| requestId | string  | Unique ID identifying the request. Please        |
|           |         | provide this when contacting the support.        |
+-----------+---------+--------------------------------------------------+
