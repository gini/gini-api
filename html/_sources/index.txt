Gini API documentation
======================

Introduction
------------

Gini provides an information extraction system for analyzing documents
(e. g. invoices or contracts), specifically information such as the
document sender or the amount to pay in an invoice.

The API supports documents in the formats **PDF**, **GIF**, **JPEG**, **PNG**,
and **TIFF**.

Furthermore there is the distinction between **native PDF** files (i. e. files
digitally created from Microsoft Word documents and containing textual
information) and **scanned PDF** files, created by scanning paper documents.

After a file has been submitted and validated, Gini first extracts the textual
contents of the document. Native PDF files already contain this information and
are analyzed accordingly. Scanned documents (like the aforementioned) image files
do not provide easily processable information directly, so Gini has to preprocess
these files using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and other methods to
obtain their content.

Once the layout and textual information is available for the uploaded document,
Gini starts extracting semantic and meta information
about the document, such as the document sender (e. g. name, address) or the
document type (e. g. invoice, contract).

In the unlikely case that Gini was unable to infer the information correctly, it is
possible to correct the extractions manually (e. g. by selecting the correct
amount to pay on the document) and submit it back to the API. This also helps
to improve the learning extraction system over time.
